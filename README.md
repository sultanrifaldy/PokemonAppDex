 Fetching a list of pokemon using moya and rxswift with mvc

 
 This project is lack of move and types api to fetch that somehow i can't figured it out so as result the coredata can't be used. If any of you has a feedback i wold be very open to discuss especially how to dealing with the api endpoint using moya
